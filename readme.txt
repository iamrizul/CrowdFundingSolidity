Hi all to the solidity code for crowd funding for a cause-
points to remember-
 1. there should be more than 2 donars for raising funds
 2. cause will be choosen by the donars only.
 3. manager automatically transfers fund to the target wallet.
 4. Process is transparent and it will refund the funds if the expected target is not met.
